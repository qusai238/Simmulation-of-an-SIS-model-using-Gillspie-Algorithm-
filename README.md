This repository includes my work done for my Mathematical and Computational Mehods for Complex Systems. In this project two ODE were given which represent two populations in an environmnet with full contact to each other, and the tast here is to simmulate the spread of a pandemic throughout these populations. The Gillispie algorithm was used to carry out the simmulation, and some pen and paper solutions were carried out before being coded using python. All my work including the problem statement can be found in this Reporsitory.
